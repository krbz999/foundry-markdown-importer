Originally known as 'Foundry Markdown Importer', this rewritten version was commissioned by MonkeyDM.

# Foundry Monster Importer
This is a Fondry VTT module that allows for simple monster sheet import via the Tetra-Cube monster builder. Using Tetra-Cube you can create a custom dnd5e monster sheet that can be easily imported into Foundry.

## Usage
To use this module simply create a monster on http://tetra-cube.com/dnd/dnd-statblock.html, save the monster and import the `.monster` file via a button in the Actor directory within Foundry.
